# Simple_Thermistor_Arduino_Project
Arduino Nano project with NTC thermistor and 12 pin common cathode 7 segment display.

//TODO: 
parts list
no library for display
voltage divider
self heating and using digital high for 5v source (note to self use multi meter and see if there is any voltage difference
