# Simple_Thermistor_Arduino_Project
Arduino Nano project with NTC thermistor and 4 digit, 7 segment display.
This project is perfect for those who are in need of a small digital display of the temperature.
This devices can be used for monitoring the temperature of a computer case, 3d printer, electronic motor, power supply, etc.

This project has a built in custom display controller for the LED display and does not use a library.

This project is mounted to a 3d printed pivoting stand. More information about the stand can be found on my Printables page:
