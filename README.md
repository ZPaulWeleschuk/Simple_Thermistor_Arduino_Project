# Simple_Thermistor_Arduino_Project
Arduino Nano project with NTC thermistor and 4 digit, 7 segment display.
This project is perfect for those who are . . . that needs a small sensor
computer case, 3d printer, electronic motor, power supply

//TODO: 
parts list:
arduino nano
10k @ 25c NTC thermistor
4 digit, seven segment display (12 pin, common cathode)
8 - 220 ohmn resistor
1 - 10k ohmn resistor
60x40mm prototyping board
wire

I should also make picture on bread board. . .

no library for display
voltage divider
self heating and using digital high for 5v source (note to self use multi meter and see if there is any voltage difference
